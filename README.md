## Homebridge 2.0 Compatibility Fix

This fork adds compatibility with **Homebridge 2.0** and **Node.js >= 18**.

The original plugin by [LeJeko](https://github.com/LeJeko/homebridge-myhome) stopped working with Homebridge 2.0 due to breaking API changes. The following fixes have been applied:

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `new Buffer()` deprecated | → `Buffer.from()` |
| `Service.BatteryService` removed | → `Service.Battery` |
| `.getValue(null)` removed (84 occurrences) | → `.emit('get', () => {})` |
| `package.json engines` outdated | → Node `>=18`, HB `>=1.6.0` |

> **Note:** The configuration format is identical to the original plugin — no changes needed if you are migrating from the original `homebridge-myhome-own`.

### Compatibility with MyHOMEServer1 (MHS1)

This plugin supports **HMAC authentication** with alphanumeric passwords, which is required by the MyHOMEServer1 gateway. The `ownpassword` field accepts alphanumeric passwords as set in the Home+Project app.

## Why own?

Short answer: OpenWebNet.
This is a fork of a great but unpublished package of [simon77](https://github.com/simont77/homebridge-myhome), forked from [angeloxx](https://github.com/angeloxx/homebridge-myhome) which was created 4 years ago.
Furthermore, on npm the __homebridge-myhome__ package is already occupied by [another inactive user](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-myhome) for 4 years as well. In addition, links to Github are directed to a "Lockitron" stuff...
So I decided to add a revealing acronym to distinguish them on npm with the ability to stay in a branch of the original homebridge-myhome github fork.

## Description
Legrand (BTicino) MyHome plugin with Elgato Eve history feature for contact, motion sensor and powermeter.

Legrand [MyHome](http://www.homesystems-legrandgroup.com/BtHomeSystems/home.action) is an Home Automation solution that can manage:
- lighting (standard on/off/dimmed lights)
- thermoregulation 
- curtains, doors
- security systems
- contact and motion sensors

With this plugin, the support of a IP gateway installed in your plant and a configuration of all installed 
systems (MyHome does not support the autodiscovery of the system) you can control it. You need to disable the OpenWebNet password-based authentication from the IP of the device that runs homebridge (ie. Raspberry) or set the authentication to HMAC; 
HMAC authentication is supported by all recent IP gateways or older one with updated firmware (eg. F454 with v2 firmware) and is required by MyHOMEServer1.

# Installation

Install the plugin from your fork:
```shell
npm install -g miobio/homebridge-myhome
```

Or install manually:
```shell
cd /var/lib/homebridge
npm uninstall homebridge-myhome-own
npm install /path/to/homebridge-myhome-own-hb2
```

Add platform within config.json of your homebridge instance:

```json
{
    "platforms": [{
        "platform": "LegrandMyHome",
        "ipaddress": "192.168.1.35",
        "port": 20000,
        "ownpassword": "yourpassword",
        "setclock": true,
        "devices": [
                /*Static list of devices*/
            ]
        }], 
    "bridge": {
        "username": "CC:22:3D:E3:CE:31", 
        "name": "MyHome HomeBridge Adapter", 
        "pin": "342-52-220", 
        "port": 51826
    }, 
    "description": "My Fantastic Legrand MyHome System", 
    "accessories": []
}
```
Restart homebridge.

## Configuration

Only the platforms section of the config.json file should be edited, the pair code and the port in bridge section can be ignored in most of the cases. 
The first part of the config file contains details about the MyHome Gateway used to interface the IP network with the plant:
```json
"platforms": [{
    "platform": "LegrandMyHome",
    "ipaddress": "192.168.1.35",
    "port": 20000,
    "ownpassword": "12345",
    "setclock": true,
    "devices": [{
```

You need to change:
- ipaddress: put the IP address or name of the MyHome Gateway (eg. F454, MH201 or MyHOMEServer1)
- port: should be 20000 and keep this value
- ownpassword: the OpenWebNet password. Alphanumeric passwords (required by MyHOMEServer1) are supported.
- setclock: set to true if you want your homebridge server to set the time of your gateway every hour
- devices: list of installed devices

The devices section contains the list of devices that will be managed. All devices contains three standard properties:

- accessory: the technical name of the device, should be one of the names listed in this document
- name: mnemonic name, will be displayed by iOS HomeKit application
- address: the MyHome address, usually in **B/A/PL** format for lights and curtains or single/double digits for other devices. **B** stands for BUS (usually 0), **A** and **PL** is the name of the addressing object used by BTicino and stands for Ambient and Light Point (Punto Luce in the original italian version)

## Supported devices

* MHRelay: Standard (Lighting) Relay (eg. F411), address is B/A/PL (eg. 0/1/10). This device supports the definition of a custom frame for on and off command, so you can specify frame\_on and/or frame\_off:

    ```json
    {
    "accessory": "MHRelay",
    "name": "Bathroom Light",
    "address": "0/1/5",
    "frame_on": "*1*1*14##",
    "frame_off": "*1*0*14##"
    }
    ```
    to use a Group, CEN, CEN+ or other command to turn on and off that load, using the _address_ load for the status monitor. Remember that HomeKit will think that the load has changed the status after the command even if is not true.

* MHDimmer: Lighting Dimmer (eg. F427, F413N), address is B/A/PL (eg. 0/1/10)
* MHThermostat: Standard Thermostat controlled by a 99-Zones Central Station (code 3550), address is the Zone Identifier (1-99)
* MHExternalThermometer: External Probe controlled by a 99-Zones Central Station (code 3550), address is the Zone Identifier (1-9)
* MHOutlet: Standard (not-Lighting) Relay, address is B/A/PL (eg. 0/1/10). See MHRelay for custom frame support
* MHBlind: Standard Automation Relay (eg. F411), address is B/A/PL (eg. 0/1/10)
  * this device defines another property called "time" that defines the configured "stop time" in seconds; using this property the driver can evaluate the current position of the blind
* MHBlindAdvanced: Advanced version of standard Blind (eg. F401 that manages internally the current position), address is B/A/PL (eg. 0/1/10)
* MHContactSensor: Dry Contact sensor (eg. 3477 or some burgalarm sensors), address range is 1-201. Supported types are "motion" and "contact". Elgato Eve history feature is supported.
* MHPowerMeter: Only supported with F421 Load Control Central, use "refresh" to set the update interval. Elgato Eve history feature is supported.
* MHAlarm: tested on central 3486. Zones for Away, Night and At Home activation are currently hard coded in plugin code. Alarm activation/deactivation from Homekit is not implemented for security reasons, so only monitor of the current status is supported
* MHTimedRelay: to issue temporized command to relays. Default duration set in "duration"
* MHControlledLoad: to control status of old generation Load Control outlets
* MHAux: to deliver AUX events to Homekit. Supported type are "leak", "gas" and "contact".
* MHIrrigation: modified MHTimedRelay using the new Homekit irrigation service

See sample-config.json for the additional parameters of each accessory.
